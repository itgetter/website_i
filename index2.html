<h1>About</h1>
<div class= listview>
<p>Hello! My name is Shay Inkpen. I graduated from Temple University's Film and Media Arts program in 2024. I've always been drawn to writing and creating things that make people smile, laugh, and hold their loved ones close. I'm particularly passionate about stories concerning found families and people coming together for a common cause. My script, "Believer's Club" was nominated in the 2024 Phoenixville Film Festival. I live in Pennsylvania with my wife, Evalyn and my dog, Flower. </p><div class= container>
