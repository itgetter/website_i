          <div class="img-caption">I spent time gaffing for an independent film company in the Poconos, helping to create the look and feel of "Genesis Valley". We worked day and night to properly illuminate the slow-burn, post-apocalyptic thriller. (BTS by Rebecca Judd, @rebeccajuddphoto ).</div>

                <div class="img-caption">I provided script supervision for the film Marina, starring Peter Friedman ("Succession") and Grace McLean. An incredible honor to work with such talented actors and crewmembers. The film was a true work of art, written and directed by Eva Steinmetz. I was very lucky to share in the experience and see the set design come to life on screen. (BTS by Victoria Wilcox, @torian.studios).</div>

                <div class="img-caption">I had the rare privilege of having my script read at the Phoenixville Film Festival. It was a great experience to meet new people, hear new stories, and experience the storytelling techniques others use to navigate their worlds. Looking forward to next year!</div>
