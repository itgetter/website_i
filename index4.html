            <p class="videoDescription">How low budget can you go? I made this short film with just me, the actors, a camera and some basic lighting equipment. It was an excersize in creativity, patience and hustle to get it done, and I'm proud of that.</p>

            <h2 class="videoTitle">Happy Horrordays</h2>
            <p class="videoDescription">This was a fun adventure, exploring the things in horror that I find really funny, and a gift to work with two excellent actors. Their commitment to the parts did a lot of the heavy lifting in what was ultimately a very silly short. </p>

            <p class="videoDescription">I love pro wrestling. I think it's so fun that so many people still get together to play and pretend. That being said, there's no ignoring it's dark side. I wanted to try to skate the line between the highs and lows of a (very very) small-time wrestler. </p>

            <p class="videoDescription">This was my kind of experimental short film - the kind where I wanted to see if I could go from having you hate a character to sympathize with them in under 5 minutes.</p>

            <h2 class="videoTitle">The Great Clone Chase of '23</h2>
            <p class="videoDescription">Guess who couldn't find anyone to be in there short film? Oh, the plight of the long-distance commuter. So I did what any self respecting filmmaker does and made a film about clones. For what it is, I put a lot of thought into it, and I think that comes across.</p>

            <p class="videoDescription">Oxventure is the most highly underrated tabletop RPG series on the internet, and that's saying something. I made this, my most polished (at the time) completed animation, as a thank you for the many years of laughs.</p>

            <p class="videoDescription">The best way for me to practice animation is to try to synch it with some sound...and why not use a clip from one of the livestreams that got me through the pandemic?</p>

            <p class="videoDescription">This was the first animation that I made. It appeared fully formed in my head and I had to bring it to life. It's a little choppy compared to the later animations I did, but I'm proud to show where I started!</p>
