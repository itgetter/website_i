          Welcome to the world of the "Believer's Club" - a story about a D&D group where Max, the DM, gets into a forbidden relationship with one of the players. To keep the relationship a secret, the rules of the game are bent to the point of breaking - and with one slip up, the group could dissolve entirely! As the covert romance pulls at the seams of their friendship, can Max remain an impartial adjudicator of the game world, or will his forbidden love get the better of him?

        <p class="thumb-caption">Max – The DM: Max is a hapless dungeon master whose grand plans for a finale are cut short when his secret relationship with jenny, a player, is uncovered. In the face of a potential cataclysm, he will do whatever it takes to hold on to both his friends and his newfound love.</p>

      <div class="thumb-container">
        <p class="thumb-caption">Jenny – The Performer: Jenny is a theater kid with a deep appreciation for nature. She loves these weekly meetups, getting together with her best friends and playing a character - like she used to do all the time. After falling for Max, the DM, she's doing her best to keep their relationship a secret, but the cracks are starting to show.</p>

        <p class="thumb-caption">
          Wills – Rules Lawyer: Wills is a great person to have on your side. Fiery, persistent, and strong-willed, they always get what they want. These meetups mean more to them than they let on, so when the group dynamic shifts dramatically, Wills is hurt — why did things have to change when it was all going so well? In retaliation, they decide to bend the game in their favor — which has consequences no one yet understands.

      <div class="thumb-container">
        <p class="thumb-caption">Wayne – The Wildcard: Wayne is a pretty chill dude, trying to get over his crush on Jenny. He knows the two of them are complete opposites - she loves nature and theatre, he loves video games and rock-and-roll - but he can't quite get over the feelings he's developed.</p>

      <div class="thumb-container">
        <p class="thumb-caption">Ramone – The Heart: Ramone is the heart of the group, an even keel through rough waters. He's got a calm, quiet wisom that everyone loves. These meetups are his favorite way to spend time together, short of the competitive gaming tournaments that he adores.</p>
